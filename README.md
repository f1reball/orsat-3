# orsat-3

ORSAT-3 was a test structure build around react and specifically react-router.
This was the first project where I experiemented with the connection of login forms and connecting data within a perticular system.

This project is also where i tried to extend out my knowledge and fully componetise sections of code with prop variables as to provide a system of ease of build functionality.
